#NINTYPE

So, since I paid github so much throughout many years, and after someone from reddit suggested so, I'm going to try github issues.

If you come here expecting source code, unfortunately it's not here. But wait, there's the issue tracker!

Feel free to put as many issues here as you want.

Do you want to be part of team NINTYPE? Actually, I'm not sure you can put team members here, but we'll see.
